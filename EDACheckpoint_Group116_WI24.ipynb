    "## Background & Prior Work\n",
    "\n",
    "During the COVID-19 pandemic, several analyses determined that people of color (POC) were experiencing a disproportionately larger COVID-19 mortality rate than Caucasians. One report from the APM Research Lab was written by Elisabeth Gawthrop, who used state-reported data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. She determined that as of September 27 of 2023, the COVID-19 mortality rate for Black individuals was around 55% higher than the rate for Caucasian individuals. The mortality rate for Latinos was nearly 65% higher than Caucasians (Gawthrop).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another study done by Latoya Hill and Samantha Artiga used data from the CDC and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). They determined that the largest differences in COVID-19 mortality rates between racial groups occurred during surges in the pandemic when the total mortality rate was particularly high. The first surge in COVID-19 deaths peaked in July 2020, and during this month, Hispanic individuals were five times more likely to die than Caucasians, American Indian or Alaska Natives (AIAN) were four times as likely to die, and Blacks were three times as likely to die. During the second surge in December 2020 and January 2021, all POC analyzed (Blacks, Hispanics, and AIAN) had higher rates of death than Caucasians. (Hill and Artiga).\n",
    "\n",
    "These previous studies have already assessed the relationship between racial background and COVID-19 mortality rates. As a result, we now want to determine the relationship between three variables: racial background, the level of urbanization, and whether the region of interest is an eastern or western state. We then want to determine the effect of these variables on COVID-19 mortality rates. By determining if any of these variables has a significant effect on mortality rates, we hope to potentially discover trends that can guide a future pandemic response.\n",

   "source": [
    "We predict that areas with a higher urbanization level will have higher COVID-19 mortality rates. Within the confined spaces of an urban region, there are more opportunities for the uninfected population to make contact with COVID-19 infected individuals. We also predict that areas with a larger population of racial minorities will have higher COVID-19 mortality rates, since these communities often have less resources available and may find it more difficult to treat every infected patient optimally. Combining our previous predictions, we predict that urban areas with a larger population of racial minorities will have the highest COVID-19 mortality rates, while rural areas with a smaller population of racial minorities will have the lowest COVID-19 mortality rates."

    "## Data Overview\n",
    "**Dataset #1**\n",
    "- Dataset name: Provisional COVID-19 Deaths by County, and Race and Hispanic Origin\n",
    "- [Link to dataset](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-by-County-and-Race-and/k8wy-p9cg/about_data)\n",
    "- Number of Observations: 3,687\n",
    "- Number of Variables: 21\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** The dataset we are utilizing to address our question is the Provisional COVID-19 Deaths by County and Race and Hispanic Origin dataset, directly sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. This dataset covers the period from January 4, 2020, to September 27, 2023, collected weekly from counties across all 50 states. It comprises around 3,700 observations with string and integer data types. The dataset is mostly complete, with NaN values only present for different racial populations. Key columns in the dataset include county name, state name, total deaths from all causes, deaths involving COVID-19, a description of the level of urbanization, and percentages of each racial category (such as Asian, White, Hispanic, American Indian, etc.). Deaths involving COVID-19 are identified by the presence of an U07.1 diagnosis code assigned to a deceased patient, which is assigned only if a patient tests positive for COVID-19. The urbanization level is determined by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties, categorizing counties into 6 urban-rural categories suitable for health analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Variables:**\n",
    "- Percentage of Race: Indicates the proportion of each racial category affected by COVID-19 in each county.\n",
    "- Urbanization level: Describes the level of urbanization of a county on a scale of 1 (large metropolitan city) to 6 (small non-core area), providing insights into how different counties address health access, resources, and disease prevention.\n",
    "- State Name: The state from which the data is collected, aiding in the analysis of regional differences in COVID-19.\n",
    "- Deaths by COVID-19: The number of deaths with a leading cause of COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Wrangling:** As our focus is on COVID-19 deaths, affected populations, geographic locations, and urbanization levels, this dataset provides all the necessary information to address our research question. However, we do have concerns regarding missing data on certain races due to privacy concerns and unnecessary columns that are not required for this project. To address these, we cleaned the dataset by removing columns such as total deaths and ensured that we only considered counties that reported affected racial groups. This step was crucial to ensure the validity of our analysis by including as many individuals as possible in our observations. Despite the removal of some columns, we deemed this necessary given the ample data available from various counties that included racial populations for our analysis.\n",

    "To get the data into a usable format, we first had to keep only the parts of the data that were deaths specific to COVID, as the data also included non-COVID deaths. Based on our research question, we wanted to analyze states on the east and west coast. So, we only kept the remaining data that were for counties in east and west coast states. Then, we had to analyze which parts of the data were missing. Even though there were columns for specific ethnicities such as American Indian or Native Hawaiian, a lot of counties had missing information for these columns and only had data for few columns Non-Hispanic Whites and Non-Hispanic Blacks and NaN for others. In order to standardize the data, while still having a decent number of obvservations, we decided to see how many counties had data for Non-Hispanic Whites, Non-Hispanic Blacks, Non-Hispanic Asians, and Hispanics, which was 170, and removed those which didn’t. Then, we added essentially a column that was for the proportion of the population not in those ethnicities (the remainder/other column basically). Finally, we dropped a lot of columns which were unnecessary to our data, such as codes for counties and states (which do not provide as easily understandable info as county names and state names) and date-range, which was standard across the whole data set (1/2020 to 9/2023). We also removed total deaths, as we only cared about COVID-19 deaths."
