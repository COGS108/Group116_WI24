    "During the COVID-19 pandemic, several analyses determined that people of color (POC) were experiencing a disproportionately larger COVID-19 mortality rate than Caucasians. One report from the APM Research Lab was written by Elisabeth Gawthrop, who used state-reported data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. She determined that as of September 27 of 2023, the COVID-19 mortality rate for Black individuals was around 55% higher than the rate for Caucasian individuals. The mortality rate for Latinos was nearly 65% higher than Caucasians.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another study done by Latoya Hill and Samantha Artiga used data from the CDC and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). They determined that the largest differences in COVID-19 mortality rates between racial groups occurred during surges in the pandemic when the total mortality rate was particularly high. The first surge in COVID-19 deaths peaked in July 2020, and during this month, Hispanic individuals were five times more likely to die than Caucasians, American Indian or Alaska Natives (AIAN) were four times as likely to die, and Blacks were three times as likely to die. During the second surge in December 2020 and January 2021, all POC analyzed (Blacks, Hispanics, and AIAN) had higher rates of death than Caucasians.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "These previous studies have already assessed the relationship between racial background and COVID-19 mortality rates.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)<sup>,</sup><a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) As a result, we now want to determine the relationship between three variables: racial background, the level of urbanization, and whether the region of interest is an eastern or western state. We then want to determine the effect of these variables on COVID-19 mortality rates. By determining if any of these variables has a significant effect on mortality rates, we hope to potentially discover trends that can guide a future pandemic response.\n",

    "We predict that areas with a higher urbanization level will have higher COVID-19 mortality rates. Within the confined spaces of an urban region, there are more opportunities for the uninfected population to make contact with COVID-19 infected individuals. We also predict that areas with a larger population of racial minorities will have higher COVID-19 mortality rates, since these communities often have less resources available and may find it more difficult to treat every infected patient optimally. We are unsure whether eastern or western communities will have higher mortality rates, but we believe that incorporating this variable into our analysis may remove a confounding variable while uncovering interesting trends regarding the pandemic response between eastern and western communities. Combining our previous predictions, we predict that urban areas with a larger population of racial minorities will have the highest COVID-19 mortality rates, while rural areas with a smaller population of racial minorities will have the lowest COVID-19 mortality rates.
